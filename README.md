# Sample Microservices Orchestrator including Saga Pattern Rollback

An example of orchestrating several microservices using event-driven architecture and reactive programming.


## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

-   [JDK 17 or newer](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
-  [Eclipse IDE or other Java compatible IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/)
- [Docker 4.17.0 or newer ](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Some useful information

 - Microservices are built using Spring Boot 3 
 - Event-Driven design using Kafka broker and Zookeeper Docker container

To run the microservices there are 2 options. 

 1. Running the whole system in Docker containers. 
 2. Run only Kafka services on Docker container and launch the Spring Boot
    Microservices from the IDE.

## Running the Microservices on Docker containers

Step 1. Build target .jar files

    /common/mvnw clean install
    /inventory_service/mvnw clean package
    /orchestrator_service/mvnw clean package
    /order_service/mvnw clean package
    /payment_service/mvnw clean package

Step 2. Run Docker Compose file
*from the root directory run command* 

    docker compose up


## Running the Microservices from IDE 

Step 1. Import project in the IDE 

Step 2. From root directory run command

     docker compose -f docker-compose-dev up
 
Step 3. Clean and build the nested projects/springboot applications 
 
Step 4. Replace application.yaml file contents with application-local-dev.yaml [*where applicable*]

Step 5. Go to each SpringBoot project and run com.patroclos.SpringbootApplication as java application.

**Wait until the log message appears on screen indicating the service is started, for example (ORCHESTRATOR SERVICE STARTED)*

## Microservices REST API URLs

 - http://localhost:8083/orchestrator-service/swagger-ui/index.html#/
 - http://localhost:8080/order-service/swagger-ui/index.html#/   
 - http://localhost:8082/payment-service/swagger-ui/index.html#/
 - http://localhost:8086/inventory-service/swagger-ui/index.html#/

## Creating a successful Event

When all services are up and running, go to below URL

http://localhost:8080/order-service/swagger-ui/index.html#/

Try creating an Order with below sample JSON request

/order/create

    {
      "customerId": 1,
      "itemId": "a9112c62-0206-4711-beaf-220c2d1bbfb0"
    }

From the ***Orchestrator service console output*** a success 'Order Complete' message should appear. In   ***Order service console output***, Order should be updated as well with status **CREATED**.

Process can be retrieved from Orchestrator Service REST API

## Creating a Failed Event with Rollback

When all services are up and running, go to below URL

http://localhost:8080/order-service/swagger-ui/index.html#/

Try creating an Order with below sample JSON request
Customer with Id = 2 has inciefficient funds to pay for the Order Item.
This will result in a failed payment debit attempt. In continuation the Order will be updated from the event, as **CANCELLED**;

/order/create

    {
      "customerId": 2,
      "itemId": "a9112c62-0206-4711-beaf-220c2d1bbfb0"
    }
